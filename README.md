# Markdown Converter

Easily publish blog posts on different platforms.



## Background

Many platforms support different styles for markdown.

I'm using [Typora](https://typora.io/), which is super cool markdown editor, but when i publish a new article to my personal blog or my company's blog, It shows differently.

So I created this small scripts, which converts Typora-style markdown to my desired style markdown.
